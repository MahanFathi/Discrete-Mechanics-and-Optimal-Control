# Discrete-Mechanics-and-Optimal-Control
Discrete Mechanics and Optimal Control (DMOC) is a beautiful approach for solving optimal control problems w/ kinodynamic constraints, which is based on a direct discretization of the Lagrange-dâ€™Alembert principle for the system. It is notably useful for energy conserving/nearly energy conserving systems.

Here a simple pendulum swing-up optimal control problem is solved using DMOC:
